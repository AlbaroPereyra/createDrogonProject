Use this script to update this software on reboot.
It can be more modular, dynamic but it is what it 
is for now.

-c 
    Use this option to execute the sript from cron during reboot.
    We are using reboot because we are assuming we are on a laptop.

-d
    Use this option to specity the directory of the repository you 
    would like to update.
-h
    Display this usage.

-s 
   Use this option to update a submodule.

NOTE:
This script has only been tested on Mac OS X.

BUGS:
This software is in beta stage and it is subject to change and prone to errors.
